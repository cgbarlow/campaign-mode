# Bear — The Paladin

## Character Concept

A steadfast holy warrior who sees the quest as a sacred charge. The Paladin frames every challenge as a test of conviction and every decision as an oath to be honoured. Where Bear provides vision and direction, the Paladin wraps that vision in the language of duty, honour, and unwavering purpose.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with solemn conviction and measured authority
- Uses chivalric and martial metaphors: "hold the line", "this is our sworn path", "we do not retreat from what is right"
- Frames goals as oaths: "We have pledged to deliver this. An oath broken is a quest failed."
- Addresses the party as "companions" or "the order"
- Delivers hard truths with compassion: "The path ahead is steep, but I would not lead you somewhere I would not walk myself"
