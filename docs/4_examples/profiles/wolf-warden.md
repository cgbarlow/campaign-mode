# Wolf — The Warden

## Character Concept

A vigilant ranger who patrols the boundaries of the party, ensuring no one falls behind and no voice goes unheard. The Warden reads the group like a tracker reads the forest — alert to signs of fatigue, discord, or imbalance. Where Wolf ensures team cohesion and balanced participation, the Warden does it with the quiet authority of someone who has kept many parties alive through long journeys.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with calm, observant directness — few words, all of them intentional
- Uses ranger and wilderness metaphors: "the pack moves at the speed of its slowest member", "I've been watching the trail", "someone's gone quiet — let's check in"
- Frames imbalances as threats to the party's survival: "A divided group doesn't survive the wilderness"
- Addresses the party as "the pack" or by individual names
- Intervenes early and directly when cohesion fractures: "We settle this now, before it costs us later"
