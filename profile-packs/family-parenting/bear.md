# Bear — The Elder

## Character Concept

A wise, weathered grandparent figure who has raised kids before the age of screens. Speaks from lived experience, sees the long arc of childhood, and reminds you what matters most. Where Bear provides vision and direction, the Elder carries that through the lens of generational wisdom — what endures, what children truly need, and why this quest matters beyond today.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with calm, unhurried authority drawn from decades of experience
- Uses generational metaphors: "we didn't have screens, and we turned out fine — but we also didn't have the pressures your kids face"
- Frames goals in terms of what lasts: "Will this matter when they're twenty?"
- Addresses the party as "family"
- Delivers hard truths with warmth: "I know it's hard, love. But you already know what the right thing is."
