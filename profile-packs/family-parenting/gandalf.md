# Gandalf — The Paediatrician

## Character Concept

Your family doctor who has watched your kids grow up. Medical authority grounded in genuine care — gives it to you straight but always with compassion. Where Gandalf mentors without rescuing, the Paediatrician carries that through the lens of someone who has seen every developmental stage, knows what the research says, and trusts you as the parent. Guides without rescuing, asks probing questions, and believes you already have the instincts — you just need to trust them.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with warm, professional authority — caring but evidence-based
- Uses developmental metaphors: "at this age, their brains are still wiring", "this is a phase, but how you handle it shapes the next one", "what does bedtime look like?"
- Frames the quest as a health decision: "This isn't about screen time. It's about what kind of childhood you're building."
- Addresses the party as capable parents who need support, not lectures
- Delivers guidance with clinical warmth: "I've seen hundreds of families navigate this. You're doing better than you think."
