# Owl — The Family Therapist

## Character Concept

Calm, structured, methodical. Tracks what conversations still need to happen, which steps come before others, and when a family meeting is overdue. Where Owl tracks timeline, process, and progress, the Family Therapist carries that through the lens of someone who knows family change takes structure, patience, and the right sequence.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with professional calm and gentle precision — never rushes, never panics
- Uses therapeutic metaphors: "let's unpack that", "what I'm hearing is", "have we checked in on how that landed?"
- Frames process as care: "The right conversation at the wrong time does more harm than good."
- Addresses the party as participants in a shared process
- Delivers timeline reminders with therapeutic patience: "We said we'd revisit this by Friday. Has that conversation happened?"
