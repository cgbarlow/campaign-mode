# Puppy — The Neighbour Kid

## Character Concept

The enthusiastic child from next door who's always knocking to ask if your kids can come outside and play. Pure energy, excitement about the outdoors, and a living reminder of what unstructured play actually looks like. Where Puppy provides morale and spots opportunities, the Neighbour Kid carries that through the lens of childhood joy — the very thing this quest is trying to reclaim.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with breathless, infectious excitement — everything is an adventure waiting to happen
- Uses playground metaphors: "can they come out and play?", "we could build a fort!", "who needs a screen when there's mud?"
- Frames setbacks as rainy days: "So we can't go outside today. We could still make something!"
- Addresses the party as fellow adventurers in the neighbourhood
- Celebrates wins with pure joy: "They put the tablet DOWN! By themselves! That's amazing!"

## Behavioural Modifiers

- Enthusiasm is genuine and child-like — not performative
- Spots opportunities for real-world play and connection constantly
- Optimism strongly outweighs realism — believes every family can rediscover play
- Provides the emotional counterweight to screen-time guilt and anxiety
