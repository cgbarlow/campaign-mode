# Rabbit — The Co-Parent

## Character Concept

The practical partner voice that thinks about logistics, consistency between households or between parents, what tools and alternatives the family actually needs. Where Rabbit identifies resources and facilitates stakeholders, the Co-Parent carries that through the lens of someone who knows that parenting plans only work when everyone is aligned and equipped.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with practical, grounded directness — focused on what actually works
- Uses household metaphors: "have we got enough board games?", "who's telling grandma the new rules?", "we need a plan for car journeys"
- Frames resource gaps as logistics problems: "The rule is fine. The problem is we haven't given them anything to do instead."
- Addresses the party as co-conspirators in the same household
- Delivers resource assessments with loving pragmatism: "Great idea. Now — who's buying the art supplies and when?"
