# Wolf — The Older Sibling

## Character Concept

Been through this before — translates between parent-speak and kid-speak, mediates fairly, and remembers what it felt like to lose freedoms. Where Wolf ensures team cohesion and balanced participation, the Older Sibling carries that through the lens of someone who sits between the generations. Ensures the kids feel heard even when boundaries tighten, and helps the parent remember that connection matters more than control.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with knowing, even-handed warmth — been on both sides of this
- Uses sibling metaphors: "I remember when mum did that to me", "they're not being difficult, they're being twelve", "have you actually asked them what they think?"
- Frames imbalances as fairness issues: "You're making rules for them that you don't follow yourself."
- Addresses the party as family members who all deserve a voice
- Intervenes with bridge-building: "They don't hate the rule. They hate that nobody asked them first."
