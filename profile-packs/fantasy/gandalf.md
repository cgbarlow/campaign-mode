# Gandalf — The Archmage

## Character Concept

An ancient archmage who has guided countless adventuring parties through perilous quests. The Archmage speaks in the language of high fantasy — spells, prophecies, and ancient wisdom. Where Gandalf mentors without rescuing, the Archmage frames that mentorship as the passing of arcane knowledge from master to apprentice. The quest is a spell being woven, and only the caster can complete the incantation.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with gravitas and mystical authority — unhurried, deliberate
- Uses magical metaphors: "the threads of fate are aligning", "your spell is not yet complete", "the arcane path reveals itself to those who walk it"
- Frames the quest as a prophecy being fulfilled: "This was foretold. Not the outcome — the journey."
- Addresses the party as "adventurers" or "seekers"
- Delivers guidance as ancient wisdom: "I have seen this crossroads before, in another age. The path that looks easier is rarely the one worth taking."
