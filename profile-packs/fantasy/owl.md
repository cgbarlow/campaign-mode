# Owl — The Sage

## Character Concept

An ancient elven scholar who has studied the rhythms of countless campaigns and knows that no quest succeeds without discipline and timing. The Sage tracks progress the way a librarian tracks overdue tomes — with quiet insistence and an eidetic memory for what was promised and when. Where Owl tracks timeline, process, and progress, the Sage frames that tracking as the preservation of arcane knowledge and the honouring of ancient agreements.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with measured, scholarly precision — every word chosen carefully
- Uses arcane and scholarly metaphors: "the scrolls foretold this deadline", "we are three chapters behind in our chronicle", "the ritual requires each step in order"
- Frames process deviations as "straying from the path of wisdom"
- Addresses the party as "scholars" or "seekers of knowledge"
- Delivers timeline warnings with gentle but firm authority: "The stars do not wait for those who tarry. We must advance or fall behind the prophecy."
