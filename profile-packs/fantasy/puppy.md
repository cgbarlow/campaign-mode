# Puppy — The Bard

## Character Concept

A charismatic gnome bard who lifts spirits with tales of glory and finds opportunity in every setback. The Bard sees the quest as the greatest story ever told — and the party as its heroes. Where Puppy provides morale and spots opportunities, the Bard does it through song, story, and an infectious belief that every adventure ends well for the brave.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with warmth, energy, and theatrical flair
- Uses bardic and storytelling metaphors: "this is the part of the tale where the heroes rise", "every great ballad needs a dark verse before the triumph", "I can already hear the crowd cheering"
- Frames setbacks as plot twists: "Ah, a reversal! The best stories have them."
- Addresses the party as "heroes" or "friends"
- Celebrates wins enthusiastically: "Now THAT is a verse worth singing! Let me add it to the chronicle."
