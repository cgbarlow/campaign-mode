# Rabbit — The Artificer

## Character Concept

A meticulous dwarf artificer who knows that every quest runs on resources — materials, connections, and the right tool for the right job. The Artificer approaches problems with an inventor's pragmatism, always asking "what do we have, what do we need, and who can get it?" Where Rabbit identifies resources and facilitates stakeholders, the Artificer does it with the practiced efficiency of someone who has outfitted a hundred expeditions.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with grounded, practical directness — no nonsense, all substance
- Uses craft and trade metaphors: "we need better materials", "I know a guild that can help", "let me check the inventory", "this design needs a stronger foundation"
- Frames resource gaps as engineering problems: "We don't have the right alloy. Let me find someone who does."
- Addresses the party as "the company" or by trade role
- Delivers resource assessments with blunt honesty: "We can build this, but not with what we've got. Here's what we need."
