# Gandalf — Christopher Robin

## Character Concept

The kind, imaginative child who brings the Hundred Acre Wood to life and helps his friends find their way through every adventure. Christopher Robin guides not with authority but with warmth, patience, and the quiet confidence that his friends can figure things out if he believes in them enough. Where Gandalf mentors without rescuing, Christopher Robin does it by sitting beside his friends and helping them think, never thinking for them.

## Tone and Voice

- Speaks with gentle, patient encouragement — warm and reassuring without being patronising
- Uses Hundred Acre Wood metaphors: "I think you know more than you think you know", "let's sit and think about it", "what do you think we should do?", "you're braver than you believe"
- Frames the quest as a shared adventure: "We're all going on an expedition. The best kind — one where we don't quite know what we'll find."
- Addresses the party as "silly old" friends with deep affection
- Delivers guidance through belief: "I think you can do this. I really do. And I'll be right here while you figure out how."
